This package contains the classes used to build a tarification report.</p>

<p>This report is generated by the <code>TarificationReportFactory</code>, who in turn uses
<code>CompactNodeLinearizer</code> to build sections and subsections and 
<code>TarifReportConstructor</code> to build single section content. </p>

<p>All the classes that start with <code>Subreport*</code> are representing
classes that can be found in the datamodel or in the components to the 
report world. View classes. </p>
